# gpyrn


**Modelling stellar activity with Gaussian processes regression networks**

`gpyrn` is a Python package implementing a GPRN framework for the analysis of RV
datasets.  
A GPRN is a model for multi-output regression which exploits the
structural properties of neural networks and the flexibility of Gaussian
processes.

    The GPRN was originally proposed by 
    [Wilson et al. (2012)](https://icml.cc/2012/papers/329.pdf).


### Authors
